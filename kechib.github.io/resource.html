I began my interest in programming self-teaching myself the basics of Ruby. After completing free intro courses and challenges, I found myself engrossed in the learning process. My goal in joining the program was to challenge myself and create websites that I’m proud of. Since being in the program, I believe that some of my strengths are the ability to rise to a challenge and develop solutions to problems and situations. I am driven by self-growth and taking something I am given and creating a product or solution with my personal flare. My overall goal as a newcomer in the software engineering field is to learn to simplify solutions to technology’s complex problems, and constantly adapt and learn new things, to keep improving the quality and ease of work for user interactions and software.
